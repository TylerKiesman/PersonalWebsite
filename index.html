  	      <p>I've always been passionate about personal
            growth and development and I'm always looking for ways to improve. I'm
            interested in self-improvement and a firm believer that anyone
            can change their life through knowledge and focusing on themselves.
            I'm dedicated to school and learning and embark on personal projects
            to deepen my understanding of software development.
            Through my classes at school and self-driven learning I strive
            to improve my skills and advance my knowledge.

		  <font size=3>
		    Worked on multiple assignments under the team responsible for the Service Line Analytics product. The first being a SQL script
			which would generate a report for the business analysts on the team to see what information was stored in one of their databases and what information
			was missing. The next was a Java program which would extract information from an Excel workbook and would generate a .csv file and a corresponding database migration
			which would insert the generated information into a database. Before, all the information had been put in by hand but this program turned what would take hours
			into a process that would take seconds. Lastly, I developed a generic algorithm for detecting duplications found in files that the team was receiving
			from entities sending them data. This algorithm was then implemented into their pipeline for receiving files.

		  Working to develop a system for centralizing logged data from multiple streams and services.

            used to the syntax of jQuery. When a user guesses a
            number the webpage responds by giving hints to the user until they
            guess the correct number. A link to this game can be
